This program removes duplicates from a sorted singly linked list by scanning through the list and comparing each node with its next node. 
When two consecutive nodes have the same value, it skips the duplicate by linking the current node directly to the node after the duplicate, 
effectively removing it. This process continues until all duplicates are removed, resulting in a list where each value appears only once.

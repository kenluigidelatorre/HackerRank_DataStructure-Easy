This program takes two sorted singly linked lists and merges them into one sorted linked list. It does this by 
comparing the current nodes of both lists, linking the smaller one to the new list, and moving forward in that 
list. This process continues until all nodes from both lists are added, producing a single, fully sorted linked l
ist.

This program adjusts three stacks of cylinders to be the same height by repeatedly removing cylinders from the top 
of the tallest stack. It calculates the total height of each stack, then removes cylinders one by one until all 
three stacks are equal or one runs out. The program reads the stacks from input, processes them with the `equalStacks` 
method, and outputs the maximum possible equal height.
